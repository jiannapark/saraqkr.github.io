This was my final project for General Assembly's Front-End Web Development Course I took in July-Sep 2019.

I made a responsive art website for my friend, which you can start navigating with "final-project-landing-page.html."

(Note: In "final-project-art-page", I have not yet got to figure out how to make corresponding shadowbox appear upon click of each image--WIP)
